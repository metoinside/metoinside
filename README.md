> _Your imagination, your talk, your voice, your thinking, and your idea turn into a software product._

Your business requirements are captured and carefully documented well with supportive materials(flow diagram, interaction diagram, etc.) and clearly communicated with the development team. In the end, your business goals turn into a working product.

My core competency is managing projects from start to finish in the field of software & web development and business process improvement. I am very proficient in both Waterfall and Agile (scrum) methods.

One of the biggest telecom companies in Montreal, Canada had success with it.
